# Webpage for Image Processing with Python Workshop on 29/04/2024-30/04/2024

A [webpage](https://bear-rsg.github.io/2024-02-19-Birmingham/) for the [Image Processing with Python lesson](https://bear-rsg.github.io/image-processing/) teaching foundational image processing skills with Python and [scikit-image](https://scikit-image.org/). Hosted by [Advanced Research Computing](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/university/colleges/professional/it/research-computing.aspx) at the University of Birmingham.  

## Lesson Content

This lesson content, which can be found the workshop [site](https://bear-rsg.github.io/image-processing/), introduces fundamental concepts in image handling and processing. Learners will gain the skills needed to load images into Python, to select, summarise, and modify specific regions in these image, and to identify and extract objects within an image for further analysis.

## Multidimensional Data Episode

There is an extra [episode](https://bear-rsg.github.io/image-processing/10-multidimensional-data.html)  covering analysis of multidimensional data (3D stacks and timelapses) including use of the [Napari](https://napari.org/stable/) image viewer. This additional episode is not part of the official [Carpentries Image Processing with Python lesson](https://datacarpentry.org/image-processing/). It was developed by [Jeremy Pike](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/arc/rsg/staff/jeremy-pike.aspx) from the [Research Software Group](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/arc/rsg/bear-software.aspx) and the
[Institute for Interdisciplinary Data Science and AI](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/data-science/index.aspx) at the University of Birmingham.
